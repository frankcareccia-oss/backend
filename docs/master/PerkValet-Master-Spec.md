## 6. Loyalty & Promotions (Normative)

> **This section is Normative.** Backend, POS, and future Mobile implementations **MUST** conform.

### 6.1 Conceptual Model
- Items → Promotions → Offer Sets
- Consumer participation is explicit and event-driven

### 6.2 QR Payload Contract (Normative)
- QR payloads MUST carry stable tokens only
- QR payloads MUST be versioned

**Conceptual payload:**
`pv:store:<storeToken>:offers:<offerSetToken>:v1:<sig>`

### 6.3 Loyalty Flow (Normative)
1. Merchant configures Items and Promotions
2. Backend publishes Offer Set token
3. Consumer scans QR and fetches offers
4. Consumer announces presence (optional, future)
5. POS records progress events
6. POS grants rewards when eligible

### 6.4 Hook / Event Contract (Normative)

All hooks emit structured JSON lines with:
`pvHook`, `ts`, `tc`, `sev`, `stable`

**PII policy (normative):**
- Hooks MUST NOT emit raw phone/email.
- Use masked values or ids only (`consumerId`, `identifierMasked`).

#### 6.4.1 Mobile scan + offer retrieval (future)
- `loyalty.qr.scanned`
- `loyalty.offers.presented`

#### 6.4.2 Consumer presence (future)
- `loyalty.consumer.present`
- `loyalty.consumer.present.rejected`

#### 6.4.3 POS Customer Identity (POS-9)
- `pos.customer.preview.*`
- `pos.customer.create.*`

#### 6.4.4 POS Promotion Progress
- `pos.promo.progress.requested`
- `pos.promo.progress.applied`
- `pos.promo.progress.denied`

#### 6.4.5 POS Reward Grant
- `pos.reward.grant.requested`
- `pos.reward.grant.succeeded`
- `pos.reward.grant.denied`

#### 6.4.6 Mobile sync (future)
- `loyalty.consumer.progress.updated`
- `loyalty.consumer.reward.granted`

### 6.5 Persistence Rules (Normative)
- Events MUST be written to NDJSON
- Visits MAY also be written to Prisma Visit table
- No Reward table is required in v1

### 6.6 POS-10 Alignment
- POS write endpoints MAY accept `consumerId`
- Store-scoped validation is REQUIRED

---

---

## 8. Security & Auth
*(From Master Spec v2.02.1 — unchanged)*

---

## 9. QA, Hooks, Observability

- Test cases reference hook names and `tc` IDs

- POS-9: Customer Identity
- POS-10: Consumer Linkage (planned)
